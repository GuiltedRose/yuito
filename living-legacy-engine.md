# Living Legacy Engine
**A World-Driven Memory, Reputation, and Legacy Simulation System**

*Designed for open innovation — no patents, no restrictions.*

## Overview
The Living Legacy Engine is a modular, emergent gameplay framework that simulates a persistent, reactive world. The player exists as one of many actors in a dynamic system where factions, characters, and regions evolve based on choices, relationships, and generational legacy — not scripted narratives.

## Core Principles
- **Player Neutrality**: The player is not inherently special. Identity, status, and reputation must be earned.
- **Legacy Persistence**: Death is permanent — but your story lives on through consequences and successors.
- **Dynamic World State**: Factions grow, fall, or mutate based on internal and external forces, including player actions.
- **Rumor-Based Memory**: NPCs and factions act on word-of-mouth, not perfect memory. Perception drives behavior.
- **Emergent Narrative**: Every world is unique, seeded, and unscripted — no two playthroughs will ever be identical.

## Key Systems

### 1. Faction & World Reputation System
Factions and major regions track:
- Relationships with other factions
- Standing with the player (and their lineage)
- Political state (ally, neutral, enemy, outlaw)
- Event response (wars, betrayals, trade pacts, etc.)

Reputation and standing shift based on:
- Player decisions and affiliations
- Dynamic world events
- Rumors and public perception

### 2. Rumor Propagation System
World memory is built on **perceived** events:
- Events generate `Rumor` entries with:
  - `source`, `target`, `description`, `impactScore`, `truthValue`
- Rumors spread through:
  - Caravans, travelers, agents, cities
  - Time-based propagation and distortion
- NPCs act on **rumors**, not direct logs

### 3. NPC & Faction Promotion System
- NPCs and factions grow or fall in influence based on their actions
- Promotion is systemic, not player-triggered
- No rigid hierarchy tied to player kills
- Promotion factors:
  - Resource control
  - Regional influence
  - Ally network size
  - Player interaction (indirect or direct)

### 4. Legacy & Heir System
When the player dies:
- The world continues
- A successor is selected/generated
- Inheritance may include:
  - Name or title recognition
  - Reputation/faction standing
  - Enemies or allies
  - Possessions or debts

The game ends only if:
- No heir is established or found
- The bloodline is eradicated
- The player chooses to end the story

Successor sources include:
- Biological children
- Apprentices
- Adopted characters
- Political heirs

### 5. Dynamic Memory & Perception System
Factions and characters track:
- Known events by the player's bloodline
- Perceived allegiance, morality, and reliability
- Standing shaped by **rumors**, **actions**, and **legacy**

Reactions vary:
- Cities may reject or welcome heirs
- NPCs may seek vengeance or alliance based on historical actions
- Quests and dialogue shift to reflect public opinion

## Optional Modules

- **Memory Codex**: A generational timeline of key actions/events
- **Perception Score**: Different views of your legacy by region/faction
- **World Event Log**: A dynamic feed of political or historical change
- **Legacy Artifacts**: Items, buildings, or myths that persist across generations

## Inspirations
- *Crusader Kings* – dynastic simulation
- *Outward* – identity and consequence
- *Dwarf Fortress* – world memory and procedural legacy
- *Skyrim* (modded) – reactive AI and faction dynamics
- *Nemesis System* – used thematically as inspiration only
